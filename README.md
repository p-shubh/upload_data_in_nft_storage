# NFT.Storage File Uploader

This Go program allows you to upload files to NFT.Storage using their API.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.16 or later
- An NFT.Storage account and API key

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   go get github.com/joho/godotenv
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your NFT.Storage API key:

   ```
   NFT_STORAGE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

1. Place the file you want to upload in the `images` directory or update the `filePath` variable in the `main` function to point to your file.

2. Run the program:

   ```
   go run main.go
   ```

3. The program will output the API response, which includes the CID (Content Identifier) of the uploaded file.

## Code Structure

- `main()`: The entry point of the program. It loads the environment variables, reads the API key, and calls the `uploadToNFTStorage` function.
- `uploadToNFTStorage()`: This function handles the file upload process to NFT.Storage. It prepares the multipart form data, sends the HTTP request, and returns the response.

## Error Handling

The program includes basic error handling:
- It will exit if the `.env` file cannot be loaded.
- It will exit if there's an error during the file upload process.

## Notes

- This program uses the `github.com/joho/godotenv` package to load environment variables from a `.env` file.
- The API response is returned as a raw string. In a production environment, you should parse this JSON response to extract the CID and other relevant information.
- Make sure to keep your API key confidential and do not commit the `.env` file to version control.
